<p>Welcome to Index dot HTML. Similarly to About dot HTML, this is only on the internet due to it being hosted on Github and all that jazz. I'm trying to get the rest of the Intro stuff done since I missed some of that stuff, so I'll spare you reading through all the same things that I put in the About dot HTML file.</p>
